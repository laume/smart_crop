# Smart image crop

The inspiration to create Smart Image Crop came from using GetPet application https://www.getpet.lt/.

Some dog profile images while opening it - was cropped not nicely.

I used the dataset from kaggle with labeled cat and dog head possitions: https://www.kaggle.com/devdgohil/the-oxfordiiit-pet-dataset

The main task was to predict dog or cat face possition and crop its image by using these data.

First task was to get square images. Later this model can be extended to get other image ratios.
